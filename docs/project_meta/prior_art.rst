There are some great projects operating in the same problem space as ``almanac``.

For libraries that work at the level below this project (some of which are used within ``almanac``):

* `Pygments <https://pygments.org/>`_: A syntax lexing and highlighting library.
* `Python Prompt Toolkit <https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit>`_: The cross-platform readline-esque library that enables all of the elegant completion (and more) in ``almanac``.
* `PyParsing <https://github.com/pyparsing/pyparsing>`_: A Python interface for creating simple grammars.

For alternative libraries to ``almanac``, take a look at:

* `python-nubia <https://github.com/facebookincubator/python-nubia>`_: A similar project to this one, that aims to produce interactive shell applications tightly coupled to Python constructs. Some of ``almanac``'s parsing code is borrowed from ``python-nubia``.
* `urwid <http://urwid.org/>`_: A mature terminal UI framework for Python.
